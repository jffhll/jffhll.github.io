## Creating a DnD Innkeeper/Shopkeeper Discord bot
*January 30th, 2024*

I always find the "shopping episodes" of DnD sessions to be tedious and boring. It's all "Do you have X?", "Roll for Persuasion", "If you buy 1, it's 10gp. For 2 its 17gp!"... blegh!

For that reason, I'm going to start building a Discord bot to do all this work for me! Planning on adding these features:

1. Create custom inventores for the particular vendor
2. Manage the inventory as players buy items
3. Interact with DnDBeyond's API to subtract gold from the players upon purchases (if that's even possible... need more research)
4. Take into account a player's particular CHA roll to modify prices

...and more!

And I'm going to name it after [my favorite innkeeper](https://kingkiller.fandom.com/wiki/Kvothe), even though he thinks he lost that name.
